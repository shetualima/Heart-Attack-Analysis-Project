Heart Attack Prediction:
## Dataset Overview

This dataset contains [Number] records of patient data with [Number] features. The data includes both numerical and categorical features, providing a comprehensive view of patient health conditions related to heart health. 

**Key Features:**

* **Target Variable:** The target variable is `heart_attack` (or similar name), which is a binary indicator (e.g., 1 for heart attack, 0 for no heart attack).

* **Features:** The features included in the dataset are:
    *  `age`: Age of the patient (numerical)
    *  `sex`: Gender of the patient (categorical, e.g., 0 for female, 1 for male)
    * `cp`: Chest pain type (categorical)
    * `trestbps`: Resting blood pressure (numerical)
    * `chol`: Serum cholesterol (numerical)
    * `fbs`: Fasting blood sugar (binary, e.g., 1 if > 120 mg/dl, 0 otherwise)
    * `restecg`: Resting electrocardiographic results (categorical)
    * `thalach`: Maximum heart rate achieved (numerical)
    * `exang`: Exercise induced angina (binary)
    * `oldpeak`: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (numerical)
    * `slope`: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment (categorical)
    * `ca`: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy (numerical)
    * `thal`: Thalassemia (categorical)
   

* **Data Source:** This dataset was compiled from [mention source of your dataset, e.g., a research paper, a public repository like Kaggle or UCI, or simulated data].
